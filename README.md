# Welcome to News 👋

> Version 0.1
> Incorporating the use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I developed a news fetching site using the News API.
> The 'news' div includes an href link, but with last minute CSS changes, that feature is currently inop.
> In style.css there is commented out code for an alternate news card layout. That one has clickable links.
> Mobile responsive down to width: 350px. Any less than that, the search results will be cut off the side of the page.
> The search bar and dropdown menu will disappear at 991px width on every page except index.html. This will be addressed in future updates.
> News API has 1,000 call limit. Since this is a class project, I don't expect to go over that amount.
> Ran out of time to create a 404 page for site. Will update as individual project for version 0.2
